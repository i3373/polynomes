# Polynomes in Finite Fields
## What does this .h do?
<p>
This .h file adds Polynomial class and operations with it in C++. Also
there is an option to operate in Finite Fields ([Galois Field](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/galois-fields-and-its-properties/)).
</p>

## What operations are implemented?
<ul>
    <li> Assignment: **$=$**, **$+=$**, **$-=$**, **$*=$**, **$/=$**, **$%=$**.
    <li> Comprasion: **$==$**, **$!=$** (**$>$**, **$*<$**, **$>=$**, **$<=$** will be added soon).
    <li> Arithmetic:  **$+$**, **$-$**, **$*$**, **$/$**, **$%$**.
    <li> Output: **$<<$**.
</ul>

## What is planned to be added?
<ul>
    <li> Factorization over Finite Fields.
    <li> The rest of comprasion operators.
    <li> **$>>$** operator.
    <li> The ability to create polynomial from string value.
</ul>

A small .h file that adds polynomial expressions in  in C++
