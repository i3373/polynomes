# Polynomial Operations in Finite Fields

## Overview
This header file provides a `Polynomial` class and various operations for working with polynomials in C++. Additionally, it includes support for arithmetic in Finite Fields (Galois Fields).

## Supported Operations
### Assignment Operators:
- `=`, `+=`, `-=`, `*=`, `/=`, `%=`

### Comparison Operators:
- `==`, `!=`
- (`>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=` will be added soon)

### Arithmetic Operators:
- `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%`

### Output Operator:
- `<<`

## Planned Features
- Factorization over Finite Fields
- Additional comparison operators (`>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=`)
- Input operator (`>>`)
- Polynomial initialization from a string

This small and simple header file enables polynomial arithmetic in C++ with optional support for finite fields.
